*Currently this list is in its childhood, we will probably dream up a lot of more stuff and possibly implement it as well*

**For a detailed changelog we refer to the projects [Wiki](https://github.com/SpaceFarerOrg/SpaceFarer/wiki)**

##Currently featuring
- Zero-G navigation of ship
- Space soccer with asteroids
- An alien with a hat (which also can be used as a soccer ball)

##Planned (more like dreamt up and possibly added in a later iteration) Features
- Space Shipping, deliver goods from A to B
- Space Pirates, who doesn't love a good fight
- Space flight economics, manage your fuel/energy to avoid dying alone in space. It's bad enough to do it on the ground (which you will)
